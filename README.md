Project Website Practice for OP

    This repo will hold my first "official" project website for the Odin Project.
    In it, I'll be using what I've learned about the basics of HTML to set up a
    homepage and then multiple links off of it to other relative or absolute 
    locations.

    I imagine I'll practice making lists and adding pictures of the recipes that
    I list.
